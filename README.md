# Python 2 - Projects
Hello. This is where all of my projects from Python 2 class will live. Here you can find some brief documentation on each project.

## Icon Manipulation (Icon_manipulation.py)
This program recieves user input for 10 strings of 10 "1"s(ones) and "0"s (zeros). The idea is to create an icon or picture that can then be scaled according to user input and inverted accordning to user input. 

I have provided my example icon in "icon_example.txt". It looks as follows:

0000000001  
0000000011  
0000000111  
0000001111  
0000011111  
0000111111  
0001111111  
0011111111  
0111111111  
1111111111

See the program in action below.

## Object Oriented Programming Teaching with Python (oop_with_python_teaching.py)
In this script a have created some simple classes with simple callings of class attributes to cover the basics of object oriented programming with python.

In the code, I create a class "Tree". Here you can see my instantiations of the objects and the objects themseleves called.

![OOP2: result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eburnsee/python_2_projects/main/oop_teaching/pictures_of_program/print_object.JPG)

Next, I call some of the class atributes of my objects.

![OOP4: attributes_results](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eburnsee/python_2_projects/main/oop_teaching/pictures_of_program/attributes2.JPG)

I then create two other classes. The first, Shrubery, I use to demonstrate inheritance of the attributes from the Tree class to the Shrubery class.
![OOP5: inher_poly_code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eburnsee/python_2_projects/main/oop_teaching/pictures_of_program/inheritance_polymorphism.JPG)

Polymorphism is demonstrated by the cut_height method. Both objects' methods can be accessed through a common function.

## CSV Querying with Pittsburgh Arrest Data (Neigh_arrests.py)
This program may be used to print all arrest charges documented for a given neighborhood in Pittsburgh.

## Wikipedia API Project (wikipedia_titles_prefix_query.py)
This program uses requests to get information from Wikipedias API. Specifically, it returns the number of Wikipedai page titles beginning with a given search prefix.
