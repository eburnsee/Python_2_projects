# Python 2 - Projects
Hello. This is where all of my projects from Python 2 class will live. Here you can find some brief documentation on each project.

## Icon Manipulation
This program recieves user input for 10 strings of 10 "1"s(ones) and "0"s (zeros). The idea is to create an icon or picture that can then be scaled according to user input and inverted accordning to user input. 

I have provided my example icon in "icon_example.txt". It looks as follows:

0000000001  
0000000011  
0000000111  
0000001111  
0000011111  
0000111111  
0001111111  
0011111111  
0111111111  
1111111111

See the program in action below.

In this script a have created some simple classes with simple callings of class attributes to cover the basics of object oriented programming with python.
